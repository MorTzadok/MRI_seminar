#                                            3D U-Net model for segmentation of prostate structures

We based our seminar project on Janko Ondras's work on [Prostate MRI Segmentation](https://github.com/jancio/3D-U-Net-Prostate-Segmentation)
Given a 3D MRI scan, the aim is to automatically annotate the peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) regions, as shown here:
